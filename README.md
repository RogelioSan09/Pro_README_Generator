# Professional README Generator

## Description
This program is intended to cut down the time developers spend on creating a README markdown file so they can spend more time coding, polishing their webpages or developing new ideas and less time building a README. The program asks the user to input information for the following topics: title name, project description, usage, license, contribution guidelines, test instructions, GitHub username, and email address. After submitting all required information the program then generates a README.md file.

## Installation
Within the terminal run the following commands:
- npm i
- node index.js
